**DNA digital data storage** is the process of encoding and decoding binary data to and from synthesized strands of [DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA "DNA").
While DNA as a storage medium has enormous potential because of its high storage density, its practical use is currently severely limited because of its high cost and very slow read and write times.

In June 2019, scientists reported that all 16 GB of text from the [English Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_Wikipedia "English Wikipedia") had been encoded into [synthetic DNA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synthetic_DNA "Synthetic DNA").[[4]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-CNET-20190629-4) In 2021, scientists reported that a custom DNA data writer had been developed that was capable of writing data into DNA at 18 Mbps.[[5]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-biorxiv.org-5)

## Encoding methods

Countless methods for encoding data in DNA are possible. The optimal methods are those that make economical use of DNA and protect against errors.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-Smith2003-6) If the message DNA is intended to be stored for a long period of time, for example, 1,000 years, it is also helpful if the sequence is obviously artificial and the reading frame is easy to identify.[[6]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DNA_digital_data_storage#cite_note-Smith2003-6)
